Fake News Detection using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)
This project focuses on detecting fake news using Graph Neural Networks (GNN), specifically Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). It is implemented with PyTorch Geometric. The project uses the UPFD (User Propagation Fake News Dataset - GossipCop subset) to explore how fake and real news spread across social media networks.

Tech Stack
- Programming Language: Python  
- Frameworks & Libraries: PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric (GCNConv, DataLoader), NumPy, Pandas  
- Environment: Google Colab  
- Dataset: UPFD (GossipCop)
